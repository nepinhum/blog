## hazelit's 'myhazel' prototype
I'm having some difficulties managing, maintaining and organizing my own projects (especially in conceptual parts). To make these easier and automate them  I decided to create an application called Hazelit but before that, I want to make a small and simpler prototype called 'myhazel'. Therefore I'll add some details here: (later)

To put it simply: I want to design a system that allows you to manage your projects; handle todo-assignment-issue-roadmap management. And interact with some third-party tools to manage them more easily.
