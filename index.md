I am wrp3, or you can call me scher, and I live in Turkiye. 

I got into software development through Minecraft and it's still a hobby for me even though it's dead :D. Then I moved on to different areas and continued to develop myself in various subjects.

In the end, I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing but I think programming is one of the few things in life that truly brings me joy. :P
